# EMCDR-MPC

This repository is based on the IJCAI 2017 paper [Cross-domain recommendation: An embedding and mapping approach](https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/program/59ae3c262bbe271c4c71f007_0.pdf), where we made an initial attempt to guarantee the privacy of the user using Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC).
